# Neural Network from Scratch

This is a simple implementation of a neural network built using Python and NumPy. It demonstrates a basic feedforward neural network with forward propagation, backpropagation, and training using a custom dataset.

## Features
- Sigmoid activation function
- Manual weight and bias initialization
- Training via backpropagation
- Loss calculation during training

#Objective : Implement a simple feedforward neural network from scratch in Python without using any in-built deep learning libraries. This implementation will focus on basic components like forward pass, backward propagation (back-propagation), and training using gradient descent.
